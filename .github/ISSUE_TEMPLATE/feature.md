## Problem / Request
<!-- What's needed? One or two sentences. -->

## User Story
> As a <role>, I want <capability>, so that <outcome>.

## Motivation
<!-- Why now; what it enables; what breaks if we don't have it. -->

## Proposed API
```python
# Signatures, types, docstring stubs.
```

<!--
OPTIONAL — Design Snapshot
Copy here any API signatures, code snippets, configuration examples, or
excerpts from external / private design docs that the implementer needs to
work on this issue in isolation. The goal is that another contributor (human
or AI agent) can implement this issue without opening other repos or chats.
Delete this section if not relevant.

## Design Snapshot
<!-- Delete if not needed. -->
```
<paste relevant excerpt, example usage, or signature here>
```

<!--
OPTIONAL — Mathematical Notes
For algorithmic / numerical issues: inline equations, sign conventions,
numerical-stability notes, edge cases. Keeps everything the implementer
needs in one place. Delete if not relevant.
-->

## Mathematical Notes
<!-- Delete if not needed. -->
```
<equations, conventions, numerical considerations>
```

## References & Existing Code
- Design doc / spec: `<path or URL>`
- Reference impl: `<path:line>`
- Related prior art: `<repo / paper / issue>`

## Implementation Steps
<!-- Concrete, file-level steps. Each should be checkable. -->
- [ ] Add `<symbol>` in `src/<package>/<module>.py`
- [ ] Wire <symbol> into `src/<package>/__init__.py` (if public)
- [ ] ...

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code lands at the intended path
- [ ] Public API exported via `src/<package>/__init__.py` (if user-facing)
- [ ] Tests pass: `make test`
- [ ] Lint + typecheck pass: `make lint && make typecheck`
- [ ] Docstrings (Google-style) on all public symbols

## Testing
<!-- One checkbox per test, so progress is trackable. -->
- [ ] Unit test: `<what it asserts>`
- [ ] Property / round-trip test: `<what it asserts>` (if applicable)
- [ ] Regression test: `<what it asserts>` (if applicable)

## Documentation
- [ ] API reference page / section
- [ ] Notebook or recipe (if user-facing flow)
- [ ] Docstrings (covered by Definition of Done)
