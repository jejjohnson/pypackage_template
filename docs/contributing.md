This page documents the label taxonomy, epic model, and issue conventions used in this project.

## Label Taxonomy

Every issue carries exactly one `type:*`, one or more `area:*`, at most one `layer:*`, one `wave:*`, and one `priority:*`.

| Scope | Labels |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `type:epic-wave`, `type:epic-theme`, `type:feature`, `type:design`, `type:chore`, `type:docs`, `type:bug` |
| **Area** | `area:engineering`, `area:testing`, `area:docs` — extend per project (e.g. `area:algorithmic`, `area:integration`) |
| **Layer** | `layer:0-primitives`, `layer:1-components`, `layer:2-models` — only if the project has a formal layer stack |
| **Wave** | `wave:0-bootstrap`, `wave:1`, `wave:2`, … — release-scoped phases |
| **Priority** | `priority:p0` (blocker), `priority:p1` (high), `priority:p2` (normal) |

Bootstrap the standard set on a fresh repo:

```bash
make gh-labels
```

The script lives at `.github/scripts/create-labels.sh`. Edit the arrays in the script to customise `area:*`, `layer:*`, and `wave:*` for the project, then re-run — the script is idempotent.

## Two-Layer Epic Model

Work is organised as **Wave → Theme → Issue**:

```
[EPIC] Wave N   (L1)   —   release-scoped mega-epic, owns a milestone
  ├── [EPIC] <theme>   (L2)   —   parallel-safe group of issues
  │     ├── feature / design / chore / bug issue
  │     └── …
  └── [EPIC] <theme>   (L2)
        └── …
```

- **Wave epic** (`type:epic-wave`) maps one-to-one with a milestone (`vX.Y-<slug>`). Groups several Theme epics that can run in parallel.
- **Theme epic** (`type:epic-theme`) groups concrete issues that ship together as a coherent slice. Themes inside a wave are parallel-safe unless the body says otherwise.
- **Issue** (feature / design / chore / bug) is the leaf — a single substantial deliverable that rolls up to a Theme epic.

Stragglers are discouraged: any `type:feature` issue should attach to a Theme epic. If no suitable theme exists, create one first.

## Issue Format

Issue templates live in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`:

| Template | When to use |
|---|---|
| `Epic — Wave (L1)` | Opening a new release-scoped wave |
| `Epic — Theme (L2)` | Grouping related issues inside a wave |
| `Feature / Enhancement` | One substantial deliverable |
| `Design / ADR` | Resolve an open design question for a new API |
| `Bug report` | Something isn't working |

Feature + Design templates include two **optional** sections for context-heavy issues:

- **Design Snapshot** — paste API sketches, code examples, or excerpts from private / external design docs so the issue is self-contained.
- **Mathematical Notes** — equations, sign conventions, numerical considerations.

Delete either section if not relevant. Both exist so that an implementer (human or AI agent) can work on the issue without opening other repos or channels.

## Relationships

Use an explicit `## Relationships` block at the bottom of each issue / epic body:

```markdown
## Relationships
- Parent: #<theme-epic>
- Blocked by: #
- Blocks: #
- Related: #
```

GitHub's task-list feature links bidirectionally from the parent, so checklist items in a Theme epic body auto-show in the referenced issues.

## Pre-commit checklist

All four gates must pass before merging to the default branch:

```bash
make test         # pytest
make lint         # ruff check .
make format       # ruff format --check .
make typecheck    # ty check
```

Pre-commit hooks run the lint + format gates on every commit. Run `make precommit` to apply them to all files manually.

Commit messages follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification — enforced on PR titles by `.github/workflows/conventional-commits.yml`.
