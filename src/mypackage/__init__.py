"""Descriptive statistics, smoothing filters, and composable transforms.

``mypackage`` is the worked example that ships with this project template. It
is deliberately **dependency-free** — everything here is built on the standard
library — so the template stays domain-neutral while still giving every piece
of tooling something real to work on: `mkdocstrings` renders these docstrings,
`ty` checks these annotations, `pytest` exercises these code paths, and the
doctests below are verified on every test run.

## The three layers

| Layer | Module | What it gives you |
|---|---|---|
| Statistics | `mypackage.stats` | `summarize`, `quantile`, `RunningStats` |
| Smoothing | `mypackage.smoothing` | `moving_average`, `median_filter` |
| Transforms | `mypackage.transforms` | `Standardize`, `Clip`, `Pipeline` |

## Quickstart

```python
import mypackage as mp

series = [2.0, 4.0, 4.0, 4.0, 5.0, 5.0, 7.0, 9.0]

summary = mp.summarize(series)
smoothed = mp.moving_average(series, window=3)
scaled = mp.chain(mp.Standardize(), mp.Clip(-2.0, 2.0)).fit_apply(
    series
)
```

Everything listed in ``__all__`` is importable straight from the top-level
package; the submodules are an implementation detail you are free to reach
into, but never have to.
