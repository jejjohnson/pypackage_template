"""Shared type aliases and structural protocols.

The aliases are written with :pep:`695` ``type`` statements (Python 3.12+), and
the protocols are *structural*: any object with the right methods satisfies
them, no inheritance or registration required. That is what lets
[`Pipeline`][mypackage.Pipeline] accept a user-defined transform it has never
heard of.
