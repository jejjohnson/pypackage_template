"""Exception hierarchy for :mod:`mypackage`.

Every error raised by this package derives from
[`MypackageError`][mypackage.MypackageError], so a caller can trap the whole
package with a single ``except`` clause while still being able to discriminate
between failure modes when it matters.

The concrete errors also inherit from the closest standard-library exception
(`ValueError`, `RuntimeError`), so code written against the stdlib keeps
working without importing anything from this package.
